index.php -> Index will be the switch for dynamic views, of which there will be three primary views: splash, teacherHome, studentHome.
Will need to generate 3 view phps for each view type.
Navigation bar: should be view dependent. nesting options (teacherHome->newTutorialTime). Can click breadcrumbs to navigate back to home. Can also toggle to student view via navigation breadcrumbs
CSS sheets needed: teacher, student, navigation, splash. Keep each css sheet separate for modularity.
